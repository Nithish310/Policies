        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 16, 2026</p>
        <p>NK Andro Technologies ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application "Smart Tools" (the "App") manages your information.</p>
        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from our users.</strong> The App functions primarily as a utility toolkit that processes data locally on your device.</p>
        
        <p>Any data you input into the App (such as notes, calculations, or files generated) remains strictly on your device. We do not transmit this data to any external servers.</p>
        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>While we do not collect personal data, the App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or your device to provide their services (such as displaying ads or sending notifications).</p>
        <p>Links to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">AdMob</a> (Google) - used for displaying advertisements.</li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> (Google) - used for sending push notifications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requests certain permissions to perform specific functions. These permissions are used <strong>only</strong> for the stated features and not for data collection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required for the Flashlight, QR Scanner, and Magnifier tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone (Record Audio):</strong> Required for the Sound Meter and Voice Recorder tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Location (Fine/Coarse):</strong> Required for Speedometer, Compass calibration, and GPS tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Read/Write):</strong> Required to save files generated by the App (e.g., Audio recordings, PDF files) and for App Backup.</li>
            <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong> Required for the App Backup and Manager tool to list installed applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Recognition / Sensors:</strong> Required for Pedometer and sensor-based tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers, there is no data to request deletion for. If you wish to clear local data stored by the App on your device, you can clear the App's storage/cache via your device settings or simply uninstall the App.</p>
        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is general audience and not directed towards children. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children. As we do not collect any personal data, this applies to children as well.</p>
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in using our App. Since no personal data is collected or transmitted by us, the risk of data breach from our side is nonexistent. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security regarding third-party services.</p>
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
